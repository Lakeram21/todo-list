# Overview
My software uses the cloud database (firstore).The software is a simple task recorder. It uses firestore datase to help use store a gorcery list. The user can write items into the database and then read it when they are ready to view it.

My purpose of writing this software is to help me understand how firestore database works and to evetually make this software a personl task recorder for my future school work.
